# PaulAutomated-Freelance-Bidding-Bot
This is a personal project using python that can autonomously log in the website, configure the website for optimal functionality, and bid for jobs depending on the preference of the user. The project is live and currently launched to several clients (26 as I first commit). The project  don't have a software verification yet but that is on the way. My aim  while doing the project was to get the most cost effective tools available to automate my boring and repetitive work. I am proud that the product is being used and helping some people automate their work. 


I am using selenium to scrape the website and mimic human control in the browser

I am using Tkinter as the GUI package
